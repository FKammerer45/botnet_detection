Botnet Detection Project üõ°Ô∏è
Welcome to the Botnet Detection Project repository! This repository contains the tools, scripts, and logic necessary to identify malicious network activity and perform analysis to detect botnet-related anomalies. This project is organized to ensure simplicity and efficiency while leveraging Python for real-time packet capture and analysis.

Project Overview üåê
The Botnet Detection Project aims to monitor network traffic, identify malicious behavior, and analyze data in real-time. This is achieved by:

Capturing Network Packets: Utilizing Python and Scapy for packet sniffing and protocol parsing.
Detecting Unsafe Activity: Leveraging configurable lists of unsafe protocols and ports.
Real-Time Threat Analysis: Visualizing traffic trends, highlighting malicious activity, and logging details.
Custom Configuration: Allowing users to configure unsafe ports and protocols easily.
Repository Structure üìÇ
The repository is organized into several directories to ensure clarity:

localscripts üìú
This directory resides inside the PlatformIO project folder (ESP 32 DDOS TEST) for simplicity and to keep everything in one place. It holds all Python-based detection scripts.
Subfolders:
blocklists:

Stores blocklists downloaded during execution.
Blocklists are ignored by Git (via .gitignore) as they are dynamically generated.
config:

globals.py: Centralized configuration of unsafe protocols and ports.
core:

capture.py: Handles packet capture and processing using Scapy.
blocklist_integration.py: Integrates external blocklists to flag malicious IPs.
ui:

gui_main.py: Main graphical interface to display network activity.
gui_detail.py: Provides detailed views for individual devices and protocols.
gui_temporal.py: Plots traffic trends over time for specific devices.
gui_unsafe.py: Allows configuration of unsafe ports and protocols.
main.py:

The entry point for running the application.
udpserver.py:

(Optional) Handles UDP-related server logic, if required.
src ‚öôÔ∏è
Contains the PlatformIO main.cpp file for microcontroller-related tasks.
lib üìò
Placeholder for additional libraries used in the PlatformIO project.
.gitignore üõë
Ensures unnecessary files like cache directories (__pycache__) and dynamic blocklists are ignored by Git.
Features ‚ú®
Real-Time Analysis: Analyze traffic trends and visualize data with interactive graphs.
Dynamic Configuration: Add/remove unsafe ports and protocols using the GUI.
Threat Detection: Detect malicious IPs and mark suspicious protocols.
Modular Design: Flexible and extensible Python modules.
