# C2 Beaconing Detection

## Command and Control (C2) Beaconing

Beaconing is a common technique used by malware to establish and maintain a connection with a Command and Control (C2) server. An infected machine, or "bot," will periodically send out a "beacon" to the C2 server to signal that it is active and ready to receive commands. This allows a botnet operator to control a large number of infected machines from a central location. Botnets use this technique to receive instructions for various malicious activities, such as participating in a DDoS attack, sending spam, or stealing data.

### How it's Detected

This tool detects C2 beaconing by monitoring the intervals between connections from a host to a specific destination. The script keeps track of the timestamps of all packets sent from a source IP to a destination IP. If the time difference between consecutive packets is consistently the same, within a certain tolerance, it is flagged as potential C2 beaconing. The interval, tolerance, and number of occurrences can be configured in the "Conf Beaconing" window.

For example, if a host sends a packet to the same destination every 60 seconds, with a tolerance of 5 seconds, and this happens at least 3 times, the tool will flag this as beaconing activity.

### Why it's Malicious

C2 beaconing is a strong indicator of a botnet infection. Legitimate applications usually don't communicate at such regular intervals. By detecting this behavior, you can identify infected hosts on your network and take steps to remove the malware and prevent further damage.
