# JA3/JA3S Detection

## What it is

JA3 and JA3S are methods for fingerprinting the cryptographic negotiation of a TLS session. This allows for the detection of malicious actors based on their TLS implementation, which is often unique to a specific piece of malware.

-   **JA3:** Fingerprints the client-side of a TLS session by hashing a string of the client's SSL/TLS settings.
-   **JA3S:** Fingerprints the server-side of a TLS session by hashing a string of the server's SSL/TLS settings.

### How it's Detected

This tool extracts the JA3 and JA3S fingerprints from TLS traffic and compares them against a blocklist of known malicious fingerprints. If a match is found, the connection is flagged as suspicious.

### Why it's Malicious

Because different malware families often use the same code to establish their C2 channels, they will have the same JA3/JA3S fingerprint. This makes it possible to detect and block entire families of malware, even if their C2 servers are constantly changing.
