# Testing Suite

The Testing Suite is a powerful tool for verifying that the detection mechanisms are working correctly. It allows you to simulate various network attacks and anomalies, so you can observe how the application responds.

## Available Tests

The following tests can be triggered from the Testing Suite:

- **Port Scan:** Simulates a port scan against a target IP address.
- **Host Scan:** Simulates a host scan against a range of IP addresses.
- **Unsafe Protocol:** Simulates the use of an unsafe protocol (e.g., FTP).
- **Rate Anomaly:** Simulates a rate anomaly, such as a packet flood.
- **Beaconing:** Simulates C2 beaconing activity.
- **DGA-like DNS:** Simulates DGA-like DNS queries.
- **DNS Tunneling:** Simulates DNS tunneling activity.
- **ICMP Tunneling:** Simulates ICMP tunneling activity.

## How to Use

To use the Testing Suite, simply click the button for the test you want to run. The status of the test will be displayed in the log window.
